        <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>LEGALITY</b> </p>
        <p>We have gone through great lengths to ensure that the Ludo game offered in <b>LudoPe</b>  are games which involve substantial skill.</p>
        <p>The game of Ludo is globally recognised to be a game which requires a high level of intellect and mental prowess. Statisticians, economists and chess grandmasters globally have accepted that the game of Ludo involves substantial degree of skill. In India, gaming legislations in all states with the exception of Assam, Odisha and Telangana exempt &ldquo;games of skill or &ldquo;games of mere skill&rdquo; from the definition of gambling. In 1967 the Supreme Court ruled that the game of Ludo is a game of skill and playing ludo does not amount to gambling.</p>
        <p>Over the past few decades, various High Courts have quoted the apex court&rsquo;s decision and stated that law enforcement authorities cannot interfere with the game of ludo played with stakes. In 1996, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court affirmed its 1967 judgment and ruled that games involving substantial and preponderant degree of skill fall within the definition of &lsquo;games of mere skill&rsquo; and added that betting on horse-racing is a game of skill outside the ambit of gambling.</p>
        <p>Various Supreme Court judgments have also noted that offering games of skill is a fundamental right under the Indian constitution and consequently games of skill cannot be prohibited.</p>
        <p>The High Courts of Karnataka and Calcutta have noted that police/law enforcement authorities cannot interfere in the game of Ludo. Based on this legal background, various legal experts and jurists have opined that online Ludo is completely legal in India.</p>
        <p><b>Elliptical Networks Pvt. Ltd.</b> complies with all laws and regulations applicable to online games of skill. We will further comply with any change in this present legal position due to any order of a court of competent jurisdiction, regulatory body, central or state government or law enforcement agency.</p>
        <p>This is however an ongoing process with litigations pending at various forums and we are keeping a close watch on the same. We ourselves also have a legal team working constantly on trying to ensure that there is more and more clarity and certainty in the laws qua gaming in India. We are also engaged in litigations to bring about this clarity in law and while the website has taken every precaution possible to remain absolutely legal, the players are advised to check their local laws if in doubt.</p>
        <p>We allow players from all states and union territories in India except Assam, Odisha, Nagaland, Sikkim and Telangana. Due to the peculiar wording of gaming legislations in these states, at present, we do not permit residents of these states to play real money Ludo.</p><br>
